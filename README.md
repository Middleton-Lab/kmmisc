# kmmisc #

An R package that contains miscellaneous functions I find useful.

# Installation #

You can install the most recent version directly from github using
`install_github()` from the
[devtools package](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

```R
require(devtools)
install_github("kmmisc", "kmiddleton")
```
